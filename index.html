    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>

      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would recommend my client some good practices that will reduce the
      danger. Most of them are described in the articles accompanying our web
      security lessons. The most important steps that I would recommend to my
      client are: 
      <ul>
        <li> Getting acquainted with the main threats, i.e. CSRF, SQL
          injection, XSS and others listed on the OWASP Top 10. </li>

          <li> Involvement of the
            entire team in the security process, including website scanning and
            checking its vulnerability to attacks and the use of a special security
            framework.</li>

          <li> Install a firewall on the server that blocks inappropriate
            network traffic and DDoS attacks. - Using strong passwords and double
            authorization.</li>

          <li> Installing an SSL certificate that will encrypt the
            connection between the user and your website. Not http but https.</li>
            
          <li> Data
            sanitization, which ensures that data is received in the correct format.</li>

          <li> Use of a third-party application that is tried and tested. Such an
            application may be responsible for data sanitization.</li>

          <li> Continuous
            Deployment/Continuous Integration, i.e. testing each new functionality as
            well as the entire application after introducing changes. This allows for
            early detection of errors and threats.</li>
      </ul>
        As one of the most important
      advice, I will quote a sentence from
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security:
      "The single most important lesson you can learn about website security is
      to never trust data from the browser. This includes, but is not limited to
      data in URL parameters of GET requests, POST requests, HTTP headers and
      cookies, and user-uploaded files. Always check and sanitize all incoming
      data. Always assume the worst."
